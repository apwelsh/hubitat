      "description": "Add support to Hubitat for Hue Groups, Bulbs, and Scenes.  This integration differs from the built-in Hue integration, because this one allows you to import Hue scenes which can be added to any Hubitat scene/group to be turned on.  This was created specifically to satisfy a need the Hubitat could not.  With this driver, it is possible to smoothly transition hue scenes for any Hue group.  I plan to add management of Hue scenes at a later time, as well as a capture state, similar to Hubitat's scene manager.",
