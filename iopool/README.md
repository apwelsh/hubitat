The iopool EcO Pool & Spa Monitor Integration for Hubitat brings leverages the iopool public API (cloud based) to link your Hubitat hub with the iopool connected devices.

To use the iopool public API, you will need to obtain an API key from iopool.  This can be done by emailing iopool support, or leveraging the iopool app.

The application works best with the iopool gateway

To install this integration, it is highly recommended to use the Hubitat Package Manager, however a manual install is supported as well.  Please follow Hubitat's guides on install custom applications and drivers.  This integrations requires both the eco-sensor.groovy and the iopool-connect.groovy to function.
