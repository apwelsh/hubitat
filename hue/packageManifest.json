  "releaseNotes": "Fixed a bug in handling of colorTemperature devices to use the correct attribe name.  Also added setting of color mode for any change to color devices.  Added logic to level 0 = off, and any other level = on for scene support. Fixed invalid data type bug resulting in default scene being set to false (Thanks Travis Tomka reporting and fixing it).  Fixed cannot cast [] bug when loading the app.  Fixed a typo introduced during reoptimization of code that prevented the app source from being installed."
