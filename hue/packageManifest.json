  "releaseNotes": "Serious bug fix that was overloading the hub due to excessive calls to refresh, even when turned off.  Fix for missing method exception.  Correct logic flaw with setLevel() for light devices. Added Initialize capability to sync devices to hub state on startup. \n1.5.20 - Added donate link \n1.5.21 - Fix setColorTemperature method to accept level and transitionTime.  Corrected parsing logic for send child event. \n1.5.23 - any change to color or brightness will turn on the associated device \n1.6.0 - Basic (initial) support for push based hue updates.  When enabled on a Huitat 2.2.9+ Hue will use push updates to trigger refreshes. \n1.6.1 - Removed testing code to cleanup logging, and wasted computations not required for this version. \n1.6.2 - Reverted hub status logic to use http instead of https. \n1.6.3 - Put back https call and fixed code that sets the bridgehost which appears to be the real source of the issue \n1.7.0 - Added support for Hue sensors (temperature, motion, and light level). \n1.7.1 - Fixed some typos.  Added logic to manage the cache of selsected devices. \n1.7.2 - Reversted cache control fix, and addressed caching issue with better page navigation controls which improves the overall flow.  Fixed a regression bug where installed scenes continue to appear in the list of available scenes to install. \n1.7.3 - Enabled new logging feature for monitoring and logging when a new device is added to Hue.  This feature is typically only used for request support of new devices from the developer. \n1.7.4 - Fixed sensor naming.  Hue only names the primary sensor. With this change all sensor names are adapted to match the master sensor name (best attempt), and a switch is added to support auto-rename of installed devices to match Hue names. \n1.7.5 - Support for tracking reachability, and enable/disable status of sensor devices. \n1.7.6 - Removed calls to unimplemented disconnect() function of sensors.  Adding a new device forces a refresh of that device. \n1.7.7 - Fixed logic error to broke the new push update feature."
